0900509242-2-10-2022_1_12 I'D RATHER WATCH A WESTERN MOVIE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL I FOUND WESTERN MOVIES MORE INTERESTING IN SECOND CHINESE ISN'T MY FIRST LANGUAGE IT'S A LANGUAGE THAT I LEARNED IN SCHOOL OK V I'M ACTUALLY FROM INDONESIA SO I MY FIRST LANGUAGE IS IN CHINESE
0900509242-2-1-2022_1_12 I'M RECORDING AN AUDIO VOICE RIGHT NOW FOR THE RESEARCH ABOUT SOMETHING RELATED TO ENGLISH ORAL
0900509242-2-2-2022_1_12 I ENJOY CLASSICAL MUSIC WHICH IS IT IS VERY SOOTHING IN RELAXING FOR ME

0900509242-2-7-2022_1_12 SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT FAST FOOD ISN'T HEALTHY BECAUSE THE THE FAST FOODS ARE MIXED WITH SOME CHEMICALS TO PRESERVE IT WHICH IS FOR SOME REASON ISN'T HEALTHY SO I AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT TOO
0900509242-2-8-2022_1_12 SO TO BE HONEST I DON'T GET ANGRY EASILY BUT I GET SAD EASILY FOR EXAMPLE IF I FAILED MY CLASS OR I DIDN'T GET THE SCORE THAT I WAS EXPECTING I WOULD BE VERY VERY UPSET SO THE WAY THAT I CALM DOWN IS TO EAT SOME ICE CREAM

0902280314-2-10-2022_1_13 I THINK I PREFER WATCHING MASTER MOVIES OVER CHINESE MOVIES BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART I THINK I FEEL PRETTY WASHED WITH THE MOVIE INDUSTRY BUT THE PLOTTING AND THE PRODUCTION OF WESTERN MOVIES IT MAKES ME WANT TO WATCH IT AND I THINK IT IS MORE IT IS MORE INTERESTING TO WATCH THAN THE CHINESE MOVIES THAT I'VE WATCHED IN THE PAST
0902280314-2-1-2022_1_13 I AM CURRENTLY DOING A LISTENING AND SPEAKING EXAM AND IT GRIEVES US TOO LISTEN TO THE QUESTIONS AND SPEAK OUT ARE ANSWERS

0902280314-2-7-2022_1_13 I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT FAST FOOD IS BAD FOR OUR HEALTH BECAUSE IT IS A HIGHLY PROCESSED FOOD THAT IS JUST TRY IT AND IT CONTAINS A LOT OF THAT FAT AND SODIUM AND I THINK I AGREE WITH THEM BECAUSE CONSUMING A LOT OF FOOD REPRESENTS FOODS WITH A LOT OF SALT CAN BE VERY BAD FOR OUR CURIOUS VASCULAR HEALTH AND OVERALL HEALTH
0902280314-2-8-2022_1_13 I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I AM QUITE A PATIENT PERSON AND WANT SOMEONE WHO WILL GET EASILY WILL EASILY GET ANGRY OVER SOMETHING AND FOR ME A GREAT WAY TO CONTROL MY EMOTION IS TO STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES ME ANGRY WHITE MAKES ME ANGRY AND IF IT IS REASONABLE FOR ME TO GET ANGRY OVER AND MOST OF THE TIME IT'S NOT REALLY THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR ME TO GET ANGRY OVER

0902484450-2-8-2022_1_12 I USED TO GET ANGRY EASILY BUT NOW I DON'T BECAUSE I LEARNED DAMA AND WHEN I AM UPSET OR ANGRY I WILL JUST THINK ABOUT HAPPY THINGS THAT HAPPEN AND NOT THINKING ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME ANGRY OR UPSET IT HELPS A LOT

0903284660-2-4-2022_1_13 THE ONE OF THE PLACES WOULD BE THE LIBRARY BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO STUDY HERE AND ANOTHER PLACE WOULD BE AN EXAM ROOM BECAUSE IF YOU ARE TALKING YOUR CHEATING

0903284660-2-7-2022_1_13 I THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY FAST FOOD IS CONSIDER UNHEALTHY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE CHEMICAL THAT GOES IN IT THAT MAKES IT A FAST FOOD BECAUSE IT COOKS VERY FAST I PERSONALLY DO THINK IT IS VERY UNHEALTHY BECAUSE IT IS VERY OILY IN THE SENSE THAT IT COULD MAKE YOU GO SICK BUT I STILL EAT IT ANYWAY BECAUSE I LIKE IT I LIKE MCDONALD'S
0903284660-2-8-2022_1_13 I DO GET ANGRY TODAY SO I WHEN I GET ANGRY I USUALLY THE FIRST THING THAT I WILL DO IS STRESS IS ANOTHER THING THAT I COULD DO IS MAYBE RESOLVED THE PROBLEM THAT MADE ME ANGRY BECAUSE MAYBE I GOT ANGRY AT MY FRIENDS OR SOME OTHER THINGS THAT MADE ME HUNGRY YEAH SO THAT IS THE WAY THAT I REALLY HAVE MY STRESS NO BIG DEAL

0938087119-2-1-2022_1_7 I AM PARTICIPATING IN AN ENGLISH SPEAKING PROGRAM AND SO I WILL TRY TO RUN THE PROGRAM AND GIVE THE PLAN GIVE THE PROGRAM ADVICE AND FEEDBACK
0938087119-2-2-2022_1_7 MY FAVORITE KIND OF MUSIC PROBABLY WOULD BE COUNTRY MUSIC BECAUSE I LOVE GUITAR AND I THINK IT'S GOOD MUSIC TO PLAY WHEN I AM DOING SOME ROAD TRIP
0938087119-2-3-2022_1_7 I THINK I WENT TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD I GUESS SO THAT'S THE AGE I WENT TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL
