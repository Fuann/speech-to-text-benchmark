a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl to describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well said on her shoulders bright grey eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked at rim slight little figure to slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly tone voice which made the accent agreeable to english years
