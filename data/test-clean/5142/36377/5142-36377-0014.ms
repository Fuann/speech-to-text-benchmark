a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright grey eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figure too slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english years
